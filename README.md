### Want to help with the translation?

[gl]: https://gitlocalize.com

Much of the translation was done using a tool called [GitLocalize][gl], which is unfortunately reaching its end of service soon. Hence, we're currently exploring and open to suggestions on how to keep this process as streamlined as possible.

For now, **always check the `vi/` version** of a document for its latest revision before starting a translation.
